Week 2: Git Version Control 
Day 1: Git. 
•	Version control allows you to keep track of your work and helps you to easily explore the changes you have made, be it data, coding scripts, notes, etc. 
•	It also allows you to work together with other programmers or developers. 
•	Git uses the command line to perform more advanced actions. 
What is Git? 
•	h 
      
State and describe nine prominent features of git that makes it the most popular and robust version control system? 
 
Benefits of using Git: 
•	Time Efficiency: Git operates swiftly, executing commands within seconds, saving significant time compared to navigating through a GitHub account for similar functions. Example: Instead of spending minutes uploading changes to a project, Git's rapid execution allows updates to be completed in seconds. 
•	Offline Capability: Git's standout feature is its ability to function offline. It enables users to perform almost all tasks locally, unlike some other version control systems like SVN that heavily rely on a constant connection to a central repository. Example: Even without an internet connection, users can continue to make changes to their project files and manage versions within Git. 
•	Error Reversal: Git offers an invaluable 'undo' option, allowing us to rectify mistakes easily. This feature can be a lifesaver in situations where a wrong modification is made. Example: Accidentally deleting a critical file can be undone swiftly with Git's 'undo' function, preventing potential data loss. 
•	Change Tracking: With features like Diff, Log, and Status, Git provides tools to track changes effectively. Users can monitor file statuses, compare versions, and review modifications made across branches. Example: By utilizing Git's 'Diff' feature, users can easily identify differences between versions of a file and track alterations made over time. 
 
 
Day 2: Git Tools and Packages: 
Git Tools: 
•	Git Bash: Git Bash is an application tailored for the Windows environment, functioning as a command-line interface for Git operations. It emulates the Git command-line experience and includes essential Unix-like utilities. Example: Git Bash enables users to execute Git commands and Unix utilities like SSH, SCP, and more within a Windows environment. 
•	Git GUI: This graphical user interface provides a visual representation of Git's command-line functions along with comprehensive visual difference tools. Example: Accessible through Windows Explorer by right-clicking on a folder or using the command line command $ git gui, Git GUI simplifies interactions for those preferring a visual interface. 
•	Gitk: A graphical history viewer, Gitk serves as a robust interface over Git's log and grep functionalities. It's used to review past events or visualize a project's history. Example: Invoked from the command line within a Git repository using the command $ gitk [git log options]. 
Git Package Tools: 
•	Commands and Command Line: Git offers a range of commands and command-line interfaces, including Git Bash and Git GUI, providing users with versatile options to manage their repositories. 
Git Terminology: 
•	Branch: A branch is a distinct version of a repository that diverges from the main project. Git allows multiple branches, offering operations like renaming, listing, and deletion. 
•	Checkout: Switching between different versions of a target entity. The 'git checkout' command is used to move between branches in a repository. 
•	Cherry-Picking: Applying a commit from one branch to another, useful for rectifying mistakes made in commits to the wrong branch. 
•	Clone: Creating a local copy of a repository from its URL, allowing users to work on it locally. 
•	Fetch: Obtaining branches, tags, and related history from other repositories to update remote-tracking branches. 
•	HEAD: Represents the last commit in the current checked-out branch, like the current branch pointer. 
•	Index: Serves as a staging area between the working directory and repository, accumulating changes intended for a commit. 
•	Master: The default branch in Git, usually containing the primary codebase. 
•	Merge: Integrating changes from different branches into a single branch to combine divergent histories. 
•	Origin: A reference to the remote repository from which a project was initially cloned. 
 
•	Pull/Pull Request: Bringing changes from a remote server to the local working directory, and a formal request for merging changes into the master branch after completion. 
•	Push: Uploading local repository content to a remote repository. 
•	Rebase: Rearranging commits by changing the base commit of a branch. 
•	Remote: Refers to a shared repository used for collaboration among team members. 
•	Repository: A data structure storing file metadata and the history of changes made to those files. 
•	Stashing: Temporarily storing unfinished work to switch branches without committing changes. 
•	Tag: Marks specific points in Git history for future reference. 
•	Upstream/Downstream: References to the original and integrated repositories in a project's development workflow. 
•	Revert: Undoing a commit by creating a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by the original commit. 
•	Reset: Undoing changes with different modes (soft, mixed, hard) affecting the staging area and working directory. 
•	Ignore: Specifying untracked files for Git to disregard. 
•	Diff: Command-line utility displaying differences between various Git data sources. 
•	Cheat Sheet: A quick reference summarizing basic Git commands and their usage. 
•	Git Flow: A branching model for Git aimed at organizing collaborative development. 
•	Squash: Combining multiple commits into a single commit for cleaner history. 
•	Rm: Removing tracked files from the Git index and the working directory. 
•	Fork: A copy of a repository that allows experimentation without affecting the original project.

Certainly! Here's a simplified set of notes summarizing the information on collaborating in Git, focusing on Git Fetch, Git Pull, and Git Push:

---

Collaborating in Git:

- Code Sharing in Git:
    - Sharing code among developers in Git involves collaborative operations.
    - Major collaboration operations include Git Fetch, Git Pull, and Git Push.

Git Fetch:

- Purpose: Downloads commits, objects, and references from another repository.
- Function: Fetches branches and tags from one or more repositories.
- Usage:
    - `$ git fetch <repository URL>`: Fetches the complete repository from a URL.
    - `$ git fetch <branch URL> <branch name>`: Fetches a specific branch from a repository.
    - `$ git fetch --all`: Fetches all branches from a remote repository simultaneously.

Git Pull / Pull Request:

- Git Pull:
    - Receives data from a remote server and merges changes to the working directory.
    - Syntax: `$ git pull <options> [<repository URL><refspec>...]`
    - Options include `-q` (quiet), `-v` (verbose), `-e` (edit), and more.

- Pull Request:
    - Developer notifies team members of completed features via a pull request on the remote server.
    - Team members review the code and merge it into the master branch.

Git Push:

- Purpose: Uploads local repository content to a remote repository.
- Function: Transfers commits from the local to remote repository.
- Basic Syntax: `$ git push <option> [<Remote URL><branch name><refspec>...]`

- Options:
    - `--all`: Pushes all branches.
    - `--prune`: Removes remote branches without local counterparts.
    - `--mirror`: Mirrors the repository to the remote.
    - `--dry-run`: Tests commands without updating the repository.
    - `--tags`: Pushes all local tags.
    - `--delete`: Deletes the specified branch.
    - `-u`: Creates an upstream tracking connection.

- Specific Commands:
    - `$ git push origin master`: Pushes local content to the master branch of the remote repository.
    - `$ git push <remote> <branch> -f` or `$ git push <remote> <branch> --force`: Force-pushes local repository changes to the remote.

- Safe Force Push:
    - Prevents replacing desired work and handles unexpected new commits on the remote.
    - Syntax: `$ git push <remote> <branch> --force-with-lease`

- Delete a Remote Branch:
    - Removes a remote branch using `git push`.
    - Command: `$ git push origin --delete <branch_name>`
